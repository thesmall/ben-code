# Drug Game

The idea of "Drug Game" has been around for at least 20 years. Buy low; Sell high. Occasionally get chased by the cops, run into a mugger or get a tip from the crazy old lady. 

It exists in many forms, across many programming languages, and for many "platforms".


This game partially functional, but is not finished. I got stuck trying to figure out how to programmatically calculate the pre-payment penalty for a loan.
