# Ben's Code

WIP

A random assortment of PowerShell scripts, functions, modules, and my PowerShell Profile.

* `ConvertTo-Mkv` - A very specific function for converting an x265 encoded .mp4 to .mkv format.

* `Get-Acronym` - Retrieve possible answers given an acronym like "LOL" or "G2G". 

* `powershelUtils` - A well-formed module consisting of a functions related to general PowerShell usage.

* `Prisoners` - A PowerShell implementation of a strategy which gives a number of prisoners a roughly ~30% chance to not be executed if all the prisoners finds their own number in a room full of boxes, given various constraints.

* `Profiles` - Committed version of my PowerShell Profile, and a means to "bootstrap" it on a new computer.

* `WeaselProgram` - A PowerShell implementation of Dawkins' Weasel thought experiment, where an original string of letters increasingly "mutate" or "evolve" towards a provided string, based on an algorithm provided by Dawkins.
